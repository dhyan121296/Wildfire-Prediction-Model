# Model Card: Random Forest for Wildfire Spread Prediction

## Model Details
**Model Name:** Wildfire Spread Rate Predictor  
**Model Version:** 1.0  
**Model Type:** Regression  
**Developers:** ENG M 680 Team  
**Release Date:** December 7, 2024  

## Intended Use
**Primary Use:** Predict wildfire spread rates based on weather and fire characteristics.  
**Intended Users:** Fire management professionals and researchers.  
**Out-of-Scope Use Cases:** Predictions without valid input features or under extreme weather conditions.  

## Model/Data Description
**Data Used:** Derived from wildfire records in Alberta, Canada (33,149 samples).  
**Features:** Includes weather metrics (temperature, wind speed), fire type, and assessment size.  
**Architecture:** Random Forest Regressor with grid-searched hyperparameters.

## Training and Evaluation
**Metrics:** R-squared: 0.995 | Mean Squared Error: 0.01  
**Baseline Comparison:** Outperforms simpler regression models.  

## Limitations
- May underperform for rare, extreme cases.
- Biased towards the distribution of the training data.
